# nanoELS-flow

A complete rewrite of the [nanoELS](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels) Electronic Lead Screw controller, focusing on improved workflow and usability while maintaining hardware compatibility.

## About

This project is a modern reimagining of the original nanoELS Electronic Lead Screw controller for metal lathes. It maintains full compatibility with the existing hardware designs while providing enhanced user experience, improved workflow, and modern development practices.

## Credits

**Original Project**: [nanoELS by Maxim Kachurovskiy](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels)  
**Original License**: MIT License  
**Original Description**: Electronic Lead Screw for metal lathe

This project builds upon Maxim's excellent work and hardware designs, providing a complete software rewrite with focus on:

- Enhanced user interface and workflow
- Improved code maintainability and structure
- Modern development practices
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Extended functionality while maintaining hardware compatibility

## Hardware Compatibility

This software is designed to work with the existing nanoELS hardware variants:

- **H2**: Arduino Nano-based ELS controller
- **H4**: ESP32-S3-based 4-axis CNC controller
- **H5**: ESP32-S3-based 3-axis controller with touch screen

All hardware designs, schematics, and assembly instructions remain the same as the original project.

## Project Goals

### Workflow Improvements
- Streamlined setup and configuration process
- Intuitive user interface for common operations
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Simplified threading and turning operations

### Usability Enhancements
- Modern, responsive user interface
- Improved parameter input and validation
- Better documentation and help system
- Enhanced safety features and limits

### Technical Improvements
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Modern development tools and practices

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This project is currently in active development. The goal is to provide a complete rewrite that maintains all functionality of the original while significantly improving the user experience.
